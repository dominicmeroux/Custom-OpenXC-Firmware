Tested vehicle as a ReachNow new model BMW i3 extended range electric rented January 22, 2017. Note that the 'hybrid_battery_pack_remaining_life' signal works for this vehicle. The 'fuel_type' signal result is '1' meaning gasoline, but this is logical because this version of the BMW i3 has the gasoline range extender. 

As an observation, the 'hybrid_battery_pack_remaining_life' output doesn't seem logical, considering the measurement should be in percent. A likely reason is that as a plug-in extended-range electric car, this vehicle has a larger battery than a hybrid gasoline-electric car would have.
