# IN PROGRESS - ADDITIONS + FIRMWARE COMING SOON!

Goal will be to have firmware that produces all possible standard diagnostic OBD signals, each at low frequency (with a couple of exceptions). 

A real-world use of this firmware would be to simply extract the signals you want to use and compile that configuration with frequencies you desire. For example, if you are working with a fleet of diesel vehicles and are concerned with the EGR-related signals, you can take those from the JSON configuration file.
